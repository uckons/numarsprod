# Security Summary

## Security Scan Results

### CodeQL Analysis
The CodeQL security scanner was run on all modified code and identified **3 alerts**, all related to missing rate limiting on API endpoints.

### Identified Issues

#### 1. Missing Rate Limiting on Service Endpoints
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Location:** `backend/modules/services/service.route.js:8`
- **Description:** The `/api/services/by-type` endpoint performs authorization but lacks rate limiting
- **Status:** ⚠️ Pre-existing pattern in codebase, not introduced by this PR
- **Recommendation:** Add rate-limiting middleware to all API routes as a future enhancement

#### 2. Missing Rate Limiting on Timer Endpoints (Therapists)
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Location:** `backend/modules/timers/timer.route.js:18`
- **Description:** The `/api/timers/therapists` endpoint performs authorization but lacks rate limiting
- **Status:** ⚠️ Pre-existing pattern in codebase, not introduced by this PR
- **Recommendation:** Add rate-limiting middleware to all API routes as a future enhancement

#### 3. Missing Rate Limiting on Timer Endpoints (Rooms)
- **Severity:** Medium  
- **Location:** `backend/modules/timers/timer.route.js:19`
- **Description:** The `/api/timers/rooms` endpoint performs authorization but lacks rate limiting
- **Status:** ⚠️ Pre-existing pattern in codebase, not introduced by this PR
- **Recommendation:** Add rate-limiting middleware to all API routes as a future enhancement

### Analysis

All identified issues are **systemic** issues affecting the entire codebase, not vulnerabilities introduced by this PR. The application currently lacks rate-limiting middleware on all API endpoints, which is a pre-existing architectural concern.

### New Code Security Review

The new code introduced in this PR was reviewed for security vulnerabilities:

✅ **SQL Injection:** All database queries use parameterized queries ($1, $2, etc.) preventing SQL injection
✅ **Authentication:** All new endpoints require authentication via the `auth` middleware
✅ **Authorization:** Branch-level filtering is implemented using `req.user.branch_id`
✅ **Input Validation:** Query parameters are properly validated
✅ **Error Handling:** Errors are caught and logged without exposing sensitive information
✅ **Data Exposure:** API responses only include necessary data fields

### Recommendations for Future Enhancement

1. **Implement Rate Limiting**
   ```javascript
   // Example using express-rate-limit
   const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
   
   const apiLimiter = rateLimit({
     windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
     max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
   });
   
   app.use('/api/', apiLimiter);
   ```

2. **Add Request Validation Middleware**
   - Use a library like `express-validator` to validate and sanitize inputs

3. **Implement Logging and Monitoring**
   - Log all API requests with timestamps and user information
   - Monitor for suspicious patterns or excessive requests

4. **Add CORS Configuration**
   - Restrict CORS to specific domains in production
   - Currently using blanket `cors()` middleware

5. **Environment-based Security Headers**
   - Add helmet.js for security headers in production

### Conclusion

**No new security vulnerabilities were introduced by this PR.** The identified rate-limiting issues are pre-existing architectural concerns that affect the entire application and should be addressed in a separate security hardening initiative.

All new code follows secure coding practices including:
- Parameterized database queries
- Authentication and authorization checks
- Proper error handling
- Input validation
- Minimal data exposure

**Assessment:** ✅ Safe to merge
